### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science graduate from Marmara University, passionate about **app development** (Web & Mobile). Currently, I'm working as an outsource **iOS Software Developer** for Banka Kombetare Tregtare (BKT), contributing to their mobile banking application.

Beyond coding, I enjoy diving into the world of **modding** for titles like Skyrim and Crusader Kings 3.
